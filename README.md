The transition to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is a major prerequisite in achieving net zero targets, that are required to stop (and reverse) global warming. 

Solutions that will make a difference are renewable energy resources such as solar power, hydro power and wind power as well as the adoption of clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Not only the production of energy has an impact, but also efficient (green) energy usage and practice are a key driver.

Technology and clever software really can make a difference here. More and more organizations and households are becoming energy providers, compared to only consuming energy, through their solar panels. Consumers are more aware of the impact electricity, heating and transport has on the environment.

Help us design a smart and interactive energy grid that helps users reduce their consumption, use energy when there is an abundance of green energy available and optimize their contributions of
energy to the grid.
