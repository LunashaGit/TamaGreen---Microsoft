#### When : During the hack in the woods Hackathon

#### Thematic : 
The transition to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is a major prerequisite in achieving net zero targets, that are required to stop (and reverse) global warming. 

Solutions that will make a difference are renewable energy resources such as solar power, hydro power and wind power as well as the adoption of clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Not only the production of energy has an impact, but also efficient (green) energy usage and practice are a key driver.

Technology and clever software really can make a difference here. More and more organizations and households are becoming energy providers, compared to only consuming energy, through their solar panels. Consumers are more aware of the impact electricity, heating and transport has on the environment.

Help us design a smart and interactive energy grid that helps users reduce their consumption, use energy when there is an abundance of green energy available and optimize their contributions of
energy to the grid.

#### Explanation of our project:

We decided to make a little daily <strong>game</strong> to raise awareness about the energy consumption during the daily life. The goal is to <strong>change the mindset</strong> of the users about the subject of <strong>ecology</strong> and to aware them when there is a peak of green energy production. This by asking questions with two possible answers which will have an effect (reduce or increase) on your four stats (well-being, ecology, health, money). Each question will cost two energy (you have max eleven of it) and some money. You will gain energy when there is a daily peak of energy. The objectif is to maintain alive your avatar (a tamagotchi like), by keeping them above 0.
After the questions you will have a little explanation about the question and after 5 you will have a random usefull fact about something interesting.

There is a ranking system, a profile page, a dashboard and achievement badges.

The <strong>ranking system</strong> is based on points that you will win earn when you complete challenges, earn badges and the longer you keep your avatar alive.

The <strong>profile page</strong> is where you can see your score and manage your information. You will have the hability to recreate your family in the app, the goal is to be able to track your consumption and production habits by enter some fields (Your home devices, your family state ...).

Which brings us to the next point, the <strong>dashboard</strong>. It will consist of a global view of categories. These will contain the data who will be showed by chart and graph (consumption, production, money saved ...) and each of these will be detailled by week, month, year ...

The <strong>achievement badges</strong> will be earned when you complete a challenge or you achieve some success.


##### More features that we have thought of

- The game is currently focused on energy, but it can be extended to other themes like water, gas ...
- Possibility to scan your electricity meter
- Connecting your electrical devices to the app 
- Top 3 of the ranking will receive discount voucher
- In the shop you can buy : 
    * More energy.
    * Style for your avatar.
    * Some bonuses
- More energy per hour to play with during the daily peak of green energy production.
- Some events will occur randomly during the game, giving you bonuses or penalties.
- Money is given each four days (one month in game).
- Notification each day a little bit before the peak of energy.
- The death of the avatar will result in the loss of part of the user's score.
- Advice given on improvements you can do daily to save energy and money, based on the data you give the app and your style of answers.
- Bonuses are awarded based on your actual environment (solar panel, water tank ...).
